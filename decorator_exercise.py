'''
Make a decorator which calls a given function twice.
You can assume the functions don't return anything important, but they may take arguments.

Imagine you have a list called books, which several functions in your application interact with.
Write a decorator which causes your functions to run only if books is not empty.

Write a decorator called printer which causes any decorated function to print their return values.
If the return value of a given function is None, printer should do nothing.
